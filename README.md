Welcome to the Weather App Readme!

This app is designed to provide people/students with a simple and intuitive way to calculate the average weather temperature and view the weather forecast. The app consists of three screens, each with a unique purpose.

*Screen 1: Student Information*

The first screen displays the student's name and student number, along with the logo for the app. This screen serves as a welcome page and provides a brief introduction to the app's functionality.

*Screen 2: Average Weather Temperature Calculation*

The second screen is where the magic happens! Here, students can enter the temperature for each day of the week, and the app will calculate the average temperature. The calculation is done in real-time, and the result is displayed at the bottom of the screen. This screen is designed to be interactive, allowing students to input their own data and see the results instantly.

*Screen 3: Weather Forecast*

The third and final screen displays the weather forecast for the upcoming days. This screen is designed to be simple and easy to read, with a clear and concise display of the weather conditions.

*How it Works*

So, how does it all work? Let's take a closer look:

- The app uses parallel arrays to store the day of the week and the corresponding temperature. This allows for easy input and calculation of the average temperature.
- The calculation is done using a simple formula: sum of all temperatures divided by 7 (the number of days in a week).
- The weather forecast is retrieved from a external API (Application Programming Interface) and displayed on the third screen.

*Benefits*

This app is designed to be a useful tool for students, providing a simple and interactive way to calculate the average weather temperature and view the weather forecast. The app is easy to use, and the calculation is done in real-time, making it a great resource for students of all ages.

*Conclusion*

In conclusion, the Weather App is a simple yet powerful tool for students. With its interactive design and real-time calculation, it makes it easy for students to calculate the average weather temperature and view the weather forecast. Whether you're a student or just looking for a useful app, the Weather App is a great ![image](https://github.com/ST10444782/IMAD-EXAM/assets/161002155/13413312-ddbb-41b4-ad0e-cbc0de64153c)
